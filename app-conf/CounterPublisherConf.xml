  Dr-elephant has the capability to publish counters from each job that it analyzes,
  provided the job has been configured to publish certain counters.

  This configuration file is optional, and configures the publish mechanism for
  publishing the counters. If the file is not present, or no publisher is configured, then
  counters are not published.

  HDFS Publishers:
  For HDFS publishers, the top-level directory can be configured. If it is not configured
  the the default is "/data/HadoopCounters". Then the date hierarchy is created under the top
  level directory as hourly/YYYY/MM/DD/HH/. Under this hierarchy, a file is created for each job
  that puts out counters.
