    Dr. Elephant now starts to provide exception info for failed jobs. <br>
    The stacktrace is the exception of the failed task that caused this job to fail.<br>
    Some failed jobs does not have a valid stacktrace reported by Hadoop. In this case, Dr. Elephant cannot provide the stacktrace.<br>
    If Dr. Elephant cannot provide the exception, try to mine by yourself in its job history page.<br>
    For example, some real exceptions appear at the end of the Application Master log. <br>
    Some real exceptions appear in the task log. <br>
    We hope to provide your more insights over these exceptions in the future. see go/scooby
